    <h2>Textbooks: 1041% - the rise in textbooks prices since 1977</h2>

    <p>According to a review of Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data by NBC, textbook prices have risen over three times the rate of inflation from January 1977 to June 2015, a <strong>1,041 percent increase</strong> <a id="1" href="#1">[1]</a>. This increase is more than three times the rate of inflation over the same time period <a id="2" href="#2">[2]</a>. The rise in textbook prices has had a significant impact on students and education. According to a study, the vast majority of students perceive textbook costs as a barrier to their success. 65% of students said they did not purchase a required textbook because of cost and 77% delayed buying their textbooks due to cost. A majority of students, 55%, felt not being able to buy a textbook hurt their grade in a course <a id="3" href="#3">[3]</a>. The high cost of textbooks has also led to students taking fewer courses and earning poor grades <a id="4" href="#4">[4]</a>. The price of textbooks is a constant source of frustration for students, and the lack of competition in the textbook market has allowed publishers to raise prices without fear of losing customers <a id="5" href="#5">[5]</a>.</p>

    <h2>High cost of university degrees</h2>

    <p>Average 2021-2022 annual tuition for public, four-year colleges was $10,740 for state residents, and $27,560 for out-of-state residents, according to CollegeBoard <a id="6" href="#6">[6]</a> data <a id="7" href="#7">[7]</a>. According to the Federal Reserve, Americans owe an estimated $1.75 trillion in total student loan debt as of the third quarter of 2023 <a id="8" href="#8">[8]</a>. The average student loan debt per borrower is $28,950. The majority of student loan debt is from federal loans, which account for 92% of the total debt <a id="9" href="#9">[9]</a>. This places student loan debt as the second-largest type of consumer debt, surpassed only by mortgages. The implications are far-reaching, affecting not only the financial future of graduates but also their career choices and economic mobility.</p>
