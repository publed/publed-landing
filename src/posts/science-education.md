# When Science & Education meet Web3

**Web3** is often associated only with the **crypto** market, **NFTs** and, unfortunately, scams, reasons that end up being reflected in the adoption of these new technologies. Being a new technology, it's normal to suffer from these so-called "growing pains" but typically history repeats itself and just as at the beginning of the Internet, the projects that added value ended up establishing themselves and succeeding.

There are already plenty of real world use cases that benefit from the capabilities of **Web3** and I could focus on the more established ones such as **Gaming**, **Privacy** or **Finance**, but I'm going to spotlight its potencial impact on **Science** and **Education**, two critical domains that have yet to receive adequate attention in this context.
**Science** and **Education** are the driving forces of global progress, but both face significant challenges in their current(traditional) state. **Science** seems to be deviating from its inherent purpose, while **Education** remains rooted in outdated industrial-age practices. There is a need for a paradigm shift in the way educational content is distributed, as well as in the way scientific advances are disseminated and propagated.

This shift aligns perfectly with the power of **Web3** technologies. **Blockchain**, **NFTs**, **Decentralized Storage**, and **Tokenization** in general, can be much more than just speculative assets, expensive images(or PFPs) or pure scams. **Web3** technologies driven by the ethos of decentralization and ownership have the potential to revolutionize the way we create and interact with Knowledge.

There is already a movement, mainly on Ethereum, called [**DeSci**](https://ethereum.org/pt/desci/) (Decentralized Science) that is gaining momentum and working very well in this direction. DeSci is making strides in areas such as funding, intellectual property management, publishing, and peer review.
Much like how decentralized finance (DeFi) has challenged traditional financial models, DeSci aims to address the shortcomings of conventional scientific practices. Leading initiatives like [**AthenaDAO**](https://www.athenadao.co/), [**VitaDAO**](https://www.vitadao.com/) (with investment from _Vitalik Buterin_), [**DeSci Labs**](https://desci.com/), and [**ResearchHub**](https://www.researchhub.com/) (backed by _Brian Armstrong_) are spearheading this transformative journey, fostering innovation and advancing progress within the sector.

In the field of **Education**, there has been a notable push for change, marked by initiatives aimed at revolutionizing the sector. Concepts such as **Learning Experience Platforms (LXP)** are gaining momentum, serving as dynamic tools for creating personalized online learning experiences. In the **Web3** sphere, several projects are pushing boundaries in this direction. Among the prominent players is Binance, which has already made significant investments in this area with projects like the [**Open Campus Protocol**](https://www.opencampus.xyz/) and the recent unveiling of [**Giggle Academy**](https://www.giggleacademy.com/), personally introduced by _CZ_, co-founder and former CEO of Binance. Additionally, organizations like [**Solana University**](https://www.solanau.org/), [**Waterloo Blockchain**](https://www.waterlooblockchain.com/), and [**BEN (Blockchain Education Network)**](https://www.blockchainedu.org/) are commendably empowering their students to navigate the vast array of opportunities in this new landscape.

The symbiotic relationship between **Science** and **Education** forms a dynamic feedback loop, where each continually reinforces the other. **Education** serves as the bedrock for disseminating scientific knowledge, sparking curiosity, and creating the researchers of tomorrow. Meanwhile, **Science** enriches **Education** by furnishing new discoveries, methodologies, and technologies, enhancing teaching practices and equipping academia with innovative tools. This reciprocal interaction underscores the pivotal roles of both fields in driving innovation, addressing global challenges, and shaping the future trajectory of societies.

Unfortunately, numerous challenges hinder innovation and diverge from the fundamental principles within these industries. These obstacles include:

1. **Centralization and Monopoly:**
   The dominance of large entities creates a centralized market structure that stifles diversity and competition, prioritizing profit over innovation.
2. **Access Barriers:**
   Less developed countries face significant hurdles in accessing educational and scientific resources due to both a lack of infrastructure and prohibitively high costs. For example, the price of essential resources like books has surged dramatically, making them inaccessible to many, with an increase of 1040% since 1980.
3. **Silos:**
   The existence of isolated silos impedes collaboration and knowledge exchange. There's a notable absence of dedicated forums or platforms fostering discussions among students, educators, and researchers. Moreover, the majority of scientific articles remain confined to the author and reviewers, with limited avenues for broader discourse.
4. **Outdated Formats:**
   Both industries suffer from archaic systems and formats that fail to keep pace with evolving technological and societal needs. These outdated structures hamper efficiency and inhibit progress.

**Web3** technologies offer clear advantages over traditional systems Their inherent features of decentralization, ownership and transparency are particularly advantageous for these use cases.

Tokenization, including gamification mechanisms and **NFTs**, has the potential to revolutionize **Science** and **Education** by promoting participation, ownership, collaboration, and transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, tokenization increases credibility, authenticity and traceability in both fields. Numerous projects are already leveraging these benefits to disrupt these sectors.

At **Publed**, we aim to provide these benefits by leveraging **Web3** technologies such as **Blockchain**, **NFTs** and **Decentralized Storage** to revolutionize the way Educational and Scientific Knowledge is created, consumed, aggregated and distributed.

**Publed** facilitates the aggregation of diverse Knowledge Artifacts, spanning various formats, into a unified Knowledge Objects. This enables all users to access, interact with, comment on, and potentially monetize this content in the future.

The Knowledge Object, represented as an **NFT**, is immortalized on the **Blockchain**, ensuring ownership rights for the creator. All associated artifacts (files) are uploaded to decentralized storage networks, eliminating reliance on third parties for data management and storage.

Moreover, **NFTs** serve a pivotal role in the profiles of researchers or students. Functioning as a Digital and Dynamic CV, they consolidate all relevant information and activities. This includes published content and interactions, all securely stored and traceable on the Blockchain.

There are numerous additional benefits and compelling reasons to take advantage of **Web3** in **Publed** that we will touch on in future articles, all of which have the potential to revolutionize knowledge.
