### Publed and Web3

At the backbone of Publed lies a disruptive technology known as a Blockchain - a decentralized and distributed ledger that securely operates across an interconnected network of nodes. Publed harnesses the potential of Blockchain to reshape knowledge production and collaboration by introducing unforeseen transparency and decentralization to the process. By embracing this integration of Web3 technologies, Publed is contributing to a new era of knowledge sharing.

### Ownership of Knowledge

Publed guarantees knowledge creators maintain ownership of their contributions. We encapsulate and acknowledge diverse knowledge artifacts, extending beyond conventional and obsolete formats. This 'Knowledge Object' encompasses various elements like datasets, tools, presentations, demos, and more, preserving copyright and promoting comprehensive knowledge sharing, thereby fostering replication.
 
### Immutable and Always-Available Knowledge

The significance of data storage in the realm of knowledge, whether it encompasses research findings or academic work can't be overstated. Determining where and how to store data, as well as for how long, constitutes essential variables for knowledge data storage. Publed relies on decentralized protocols for storage to ensure permanent availability and accessibility. By distributing knowledge data across a network of nodes, we safeguard against data loss and uphold the integrity of knowledge data.

### Publed and AI

Just as Publed adopted Web3 for scientific publishing, the fusion of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with Web3 forms a powerful synergy. In the context of scientific publishing, the challenge of matching reviewers with papers persists. Publed's AI-driven system pairs 'Knowledge Objects' with qualified reviewers, analyzing their expertise and history. This innovation streamlines reviews, accelerating evaluations without compromising quality. With AI and scientific publishing merging, Publed leads the way toward a future marked by precision, efficiency, and meaningful progress.

## You are just one step away from embarking on a knowledge-sharing revolution!
